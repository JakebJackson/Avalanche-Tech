# Bootcamp Project 3 - Avalanche Tech: A custom PC build order website.
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This web application aims to allow users to create custom build orders for a Desktop Computer by selecting the parts they would like from a list supplied by the website.

The website will automatically update to restrict incompaitible parts and will automatically calculate and display the total cost of the build to the user.

The user will have the option to see their current/prior orders and cancel/update them until the build starts.

The owner will have a private portal to show the currently placed orders and the details of the orders, along with profit and cost for each build.
